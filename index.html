    <td><p>A pangolins diet consists of ants, termites and larvae. They are also know as "the scaly anteater".As they have no teeth pangolins pick up food with their sticky tongues which can sometimes reach lengths greater than the animal’s body. The scientific name of a pangolin 
   is Pholidota. Pangolins are genrally shy animals and will not attack humans.</p> </td>

      <td><p>The Manis pentadactyla which is the scientific name of the chinese pangolin is an  insectivore they are 31 inches long and weigh  4.4 to 15 pounds they are crittically endangered. like all pangolins they resemble an armadillo in looks and an anteater in behavior but they are more closely related to cats and bears than an anteater. Once found in forests and grasslands across southern China, parts of Southeast Asia, into India, Bangladesh, and Nepal, poaching and trafficking have left the Chinese pangolin critically endangered. Despite protections in some parts of Asia including China and Vietnam pangolin meat is considered a delicacy and its scales are used in traditional medicine despite the fact that there is no evidence that the scales cure anything.Chinese pangolins are nocturnal solitary animals that spend most of their time on the ground but they are also good climbers. During the day they stay in the burrows they’ve dug out with their long front claws. Pangolins live alone except when it comes time to mate. Females typically bear a single offspring at a time Chinese pangolin males which are much bigger than the females stay with the family until the baby is weaned. A baby pangolin will ride on its mother’s back..</p></td>
